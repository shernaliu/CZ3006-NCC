## Lab 4 - Analyzing Network Data Log

First-hand experience in doing basic analysis of data log.

I have wrote a Python Jupyter notebook file to decipher the network traffic data captured.

The program is able to:
- List top 5 talkers
- List top 5 talkers
- List top 5 applications
- Calculate total traffic
- (Extra) List top 5 bi-directional communication pairs
- (Extra) Barchart visualization of top 5 bi-directional communication pairs

## Assignment 1 - Throughput Analyses for ALOHA and CSMA network protocols
Assignment 1 Report on Throughput Analyses for random access protocols ALOHA and Carrier-Sense Multiple-Access (CSMA). Specifically, Pure ALOHA, Slotted ALOHA, Non-Persistent CSMA, 1-Persistent CSMA and 0.05-Persistent CSMA.

The graph is visualized using Scilab, a free and open-source alternative to Matlab that is used for numerical computation.

From my thorough analyses, P-Persistent CSMA is the best solution as it achieves the highest maximum throughput although this comes at the expense of the cost. If cost is a important factor to consider, then the Pure ALOHA protocol is a more suitable solution.

You are most welcome to view my Scilab codes and report in full detail.

## Installing CZ3006-NCC

```
# clone this project
git clone https://github.com/shernaliu/CZ3006-NCC.git
```

No dependencies required.

You need to install Python and Jupyter Notebook in order to open .ipynb file.

You need to install Scilab in order to execute .sce file.

I hope you enjoy and happy learning! :smile:
